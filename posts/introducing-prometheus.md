## What is Prometheus?

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, it has become a leading solution for monitoring modern, cloud-native applications and infrastructure. Prometheus is now a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/projects/prometheus/) graduated project, trusted by organizations worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional Data Model:** Prometheus stores time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs (labels).
- **Flexible Query Language:** The [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) query language allows powerful and flexible queries for real-time analysis.
- **No Dependency on Distributed Storage:** Each Prometheus server is standalone, simplifying deployment and reliability.
- **Pull Model over HTTP:** Prometheus scrapes metrics from configured targets at specified intervals.
- **Service Discovery and Static Configuration:** Easily integrates with dynamic environments like Kubernetes.
- **Alerting:** Integrated alert manager for handling alerts and notifications.

## Why Use Prometheus?

Prometheus is designed for reliability and scalability, making it ideal for microservices, containers, and dynamic cloud environments. Its ecosystem includes exporters, integrations, and visualization tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
