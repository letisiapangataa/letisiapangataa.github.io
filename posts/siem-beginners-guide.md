Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a foundational technology for modern cyber security operations. SIEM solutions collect, analyse, and correlate security data from across an organisationâ€™s IT environment, helping security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats.


## What is SIEM?

SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It combines two key functions:
- **Security Information Management (SIM):** Collects and stores log data for analysis and compliance.
- **Security Event Management (SEM):** Monitors, analyses, and correlates real-time events for threat detection.


## Why is SIEM Important?

- **Centralised Visibility:** Aggregate logs and events from servers, endpoints, network devices, and cloud services.
- **Threat Detection:** Identify suspicious activity, policy violations, and potential attacks.
- **Incident Response:** Enable faster investigation and remediation of security incidents.
- **Compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) with audit trails and reporting.


## Key Features of SIEM

- **Log Collection & Normalisation:** Ingest data from diverse sources and standardise formats.
- **Correlation Rules:** Detect complex attack patterns by linking related events.
- **Alerting:** Notify security teams of critical incidents in real time.
- **Dashboards & Reporting:** Visualise security posture and trends.
- **Forensics & Investigation:** Drill down into historical data for root cause analysis.


## How SIEM Works

1. **Data Collection:** Agents or APIs gather logs from endpoints, servers, firewalls, and cloud services.
2. **Normalisation:** Data is parsed and standardised for analysis.
3. **Correlation & Analysis:** Rules and machine learning identify threats and anomalies.
4. **Alerting:** Security teams are notified of high-risk events.
5. **Response:** Incidents are investigated and remediated.


## Popular SIEM Solutions

- **Microsoft Sentinel** (cloud-native)
- **Splunk**
- **IBM QRadar**
- **Elastic SIEM**
- **ArcSight**


## Best Practices for SIEM Deployment

- **Start with Critical Data Sources:** Onboard domain controllers, firewalls, and cloud accounts first.
- **Tune Correlation Rules:** Reduce false positives by customising alerts.
- **Automate Where Possible:** Use playbooks and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) integrations.
- **Regularly Review & Update:** Adapt to new threats and business changes.


## Conclusion

A SIEM is essential for proactive security monitoring and compliance. By centralising and analysing security data, organisations can detect threats faster and respond more effectively.
