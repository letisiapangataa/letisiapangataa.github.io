## What is Microsoft Sentinel?

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. It helps organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security threats across the enterprise.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Connects to Microsoft and third-party sources (Azure, Office 365, firewalls, etc.)
- **Analytics**: Uses built-in and custom rules to detect threats
- **Investigation**: Provides workbooks and investigation graphs for deep analysis
- **Automation**: Automates responses with playbooks (using Azure Logic Apps)
- **Integration**: Works with Microsoft Defender, Azure AD, and more

## Getting Started

### 1. Provision Microsoft Sentinel

- Go to the Azure Portal
- Create or select a Log Analytics workspace
- Add Microsoft Sentinel to the workspace

### 2. Connect Data Sources

- Use built-in connectors for Azure, Microsoft 365, AWS, and more
- Configure syslog or Common Event Format (CEF) for on-premises devices

### 3. Create Analytics Rules

- Use templates or build custom rules to detect suspicious activity
- Enable alert notifications

### 4. Investigate Incidents

- Use the Investigation Graph to visualize attack paths
- Drill down into logs and related entities

### 5. Automate Responses

- Create playbooks with Azure Logic Apps to automate actions (e.g., send alerts, block users)

## Best Practices

- Onboard critical data sources first (Azure AD, Office 365, firewalls)
- Regularly review and tune analytics rules
- Use workbooks for custom dashboards and reporting
- Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for security
