This is an independently led **Applied Learning Project** for a Security Monitoring Dashboard, developed as part of a practical demonstration of cloud-native security integration. It builds upon my experience as a Cloud Solution Architect Intern at Microsoft, where I gained hands-on exposure to Microsoft’s cybersecurity solutions and the broader suite of Microsoft products, in this case, Power Platform’s very own Power BI.

The project combines insights from real-world security engagements and my academic background in cybersecurity, data analytics, and cloud engineering, applying hands-on skills in threat modelling, **Azure Sentinel**, and **Power BI** developed through both industry, independent, and tertiary education.

**Technologies Used:**  
Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics, Power BI, KQL, DAX, Azure AD

## Introduction: The Security Challenge

Today’s security teams need up-to-date views of their organisation’s security posture. Older tools often work separately, making it difficult to connect events and identify hidden threats. This post explains how to build a security dashboard using **Azure Sentinel** and **Power BI** for clear, connected, and useful visualisations—compiling security information into a single dashboard.

## Idea: What We Want

Our Security Monitoring Dashboard provides:
- **Real-time threat visualisation** across multiple data sources
- **Geographic mapping** of security incidents
- **Automated alerting** for critical security events
- **Executive-level dashboards** with security KPIs
- **Drill-down capabilities** for detailed threat analysis

## Tools: Technology Stack

### Core Components
- **Azure Sentinel**: Cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution
- **Log Analytics**: Centralised log collection and querying engine
- **Power BI**: Business intelligence and visualisation platform
- **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**: Microsoft’s powerful query language (relatively new to me)

### Supporting Services
- **Azure Active Directory**: Identity and access management
- **Microsoft Defender**: Endpoint and cloud workload protection
- **Azure Monitor**: Comprehensive monitoring solution

## Step-By-Step: Development Process

### Step 1: Data Foundation Setup

#### 1.1 Azure Sentinel Configuration
First, we set up Azure Sentinel to collect security data from various sources:

```bash
# Enable required data connectors
- Azure Active Directory Sign-ins
- Azure Activity Logs
- Security Events via Legacy Agent
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Common Event Format (CEF)
```

#### 1.2 Log Analytics Workspace Setup
The Log Analytics workspace serves as our data lake:
- **Retention Policy**: 90+ days for trend analysis
- **Data Export**: Long-term storage for compliance
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

### Step 2: Query Development

#### 2.1 KQL Query Design
We developed seven core queries targeting different threat scenarios:

**Top Security Alerts Query**:
```kql
SecurityAlert
| summarise Count = count() by AlertName, Severity
| top 10 by Count desc
```

**Failed Sign-ins with Geographic Data**:
```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != "0"
| summarise FailedAttempts = count() by UserPrincipalName, Location, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedAttempts > 5
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Network Anomaly Detection**:
```kql
CommonSecurityLog
| where DeviceVendor == "Palo Alto Networks"
| where Activity == "TRAFFIC"
| extend SentBytes = todouble(SentBytes), ReceivedBytes = todouble(ReceivedBytes)
| where SentBytes > 1000000000 or ReceivedBytes > 1000000000  // > 1GB
| summarise TotalSent = sum(SentBytes), TotalReceived = sum(ReceivedBytes) 
    by SourceIP, DestinationIP, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### 2.2 Query Optimisation Strategies
- **Time-based filtering** to reduce data volume
- **Aggregation techniques** for performance
- **Index-friendly** where clauses
- **Incremental refresh** patterns

### Step 3: Power BI Dashboard Development

#### 3.1 Data Connection Architecture
We implemented a robust connection strategy:

```python
# Connection flow
Azure Sentinel → Log Analytics API → Power BI Gateway → Power BI Service
```

**Authentication Methods**:
- Service Principal for automated refresh
- Azure AD integration for user access
- Row-level security for data governance

#### 3.2 Dashboard Design Philosophy
Our four-page dashboard structure follows security operations workflow:

**Page 1: Security Overview**
- Security score calculation using DAX
- High-level KPIs and trend analysis
- Executive summary visuals

**Page 2: Network Security**
- Geographic threat mapping
- IP reputation analysis
- Traffic pattern anomalies

**Page 3: Threat Analysis**
- Malware detection trends
- Attack technique analysis
- IOC (Indicators of Compromise) tracking

**Page 4: Incident Response**
- Active incident status
- Response time metrics
- Team workload distribution

#### 3.3 Advanced DAX Calculations

**Security Score Calculation**:
```dax
Security Score = 
100 - (
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(SecurityAlert, SecurityAlert[AlertSeverity] = "Critical")) * 10 +
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(SecurityAlert, SecurityAlert[AlertSeverity] = "High")) * 5 +
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(SecurityAlert, SecurityAlert[AlertSeverity] = "Medium")) * 2 +
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(SecurityAlert, SecurityAlert[AlertSeverity] = "Low")) * 1
)
```

**Dynamic Risk Assessment**:
```dax
Risk Level = 
SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        [Security Score] >= 90, "Low Risk",
        [Security Score] >= 70, "Medium Risk", 
        [Security Score] >= 50, "High Risk",
        "Critical Risk"
)
```

### Step 4: Visualisation Strategy (Visuals, Visuals, Visuals)

#### 4.1 Colour Psychology in Security Dashboards
We implemented a consistent colour scheme based on security industry standards:
- **Critical (#FF4444)**: Immediate attention required
- **High (#FF8800)**: High priority investigation
- **Medium (#FFCC00)**: Moderate risk monitoring
- **Low (#00AA44)**: Normal security state
- **Info (#0088CC)**: Informational context

#### 4.2 Visual Selection Rationale
- **Gauge Charts**: Instant security score recognition
- **Geographic Maps**: Spatial threat intelligence
- **Time Series**: Trend identification and prediction
- **Heat Maps**: Pattern recognition in large datasets
- **Tables**: Detailed drill-down capabilities

## Technical Challenges and Solutions
