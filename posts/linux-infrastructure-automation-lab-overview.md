## Introduction

The Linux Infrastructure Automation Lab is a comprehensive toolkit designed to automate, secure, and monitor Linux server environments. It provides scripts, configuration files, and dashboards to help system administrators streamline infrastructure management, enforce security best practices, and ensure operational resilience.

You can find the source code and further documentation for the Linux Infrastructure Automation Lab on [GitHub](https://github.com/letisiapangataa/linux-infra-automation-lab).


## Why Linux Matters

Linux is foundational to modern infrastructure due to its flexibility, security, and widespread adoption in servers and cloud environments. Mastery of Linux is essential for system engineers and administrators who manage scalable, resilient, and secure systems.

## Role of Automation Labs

Automation labs, like this one, provide hands-on environments to practice and implement best practices in Linux administration. They enable users to:

- Automate repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors.
- Enforce security and compliance through scripted configurations.
- Monitor systems proactively for performance and reliability.
- Document and version-control infrastructure for reproducibility.

This post introduces the Linux Infrastructure Automation Lab, outlines its structure, and explains how it supports efficient, secure, and consistent Linux system management.

## Development Process

### 1. Project Structure
- **scripts/**: Contains automation scripts for backup, hardening, log aggregation, and monitoring setup.
- **configs/**: Holds configuration files for system security (e.g., `fail2ban`, `sshd`, `sysctl`).
- **grafana/**: Includes a pre-built Grafana dashboard for infrastructure monitoring.
- **docs/**: Documentation for architecture, installation, and recovery.
- **Makefile**: Automates installation and verification tasks.
- **setup.sh**: Main setup script to initialize the environment.
- **verify-project.sh**: Script to verify the setup and configuration.

### 2. Development Workflow
- Scripts are written in Bash and tested on popular Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
- Configuration files are version-controlled for consistency and easy rollback.
- Documentation is maintained in Markdown for clarity and accessibility.
- The Makefile provides a unified interface for common tasks (install, verify, clean).

## How to Run the System

### Prerequisites
- A Linux environment (physical, VM, or WSL).
- Bash shell and standard Linux utilities.
- (Optional) `dos2unix` utility to fix line endings if cloning from Windows.

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/letisiapangataa/linux-infra-automation-lab.git
   cd linux-infra-automation-lab
   ```
2. **Fix Line Endings (if needed):**
   If you cloned the repo on Windows, convert scripts to Unix line endings:
   ```sh
   find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec dos2unix {} +
   ```
3. **Make Scripts Executable:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x setup.sh verify-project.sh scripts/*.sh
   ```
4. **Run the Setup Script:**
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   Or use the Makefile:
   ```sh
   sudo make install
   ```
5. **Verify the Setup:**
   ```sh
   ./verify-project.sh
   ```
