## What is RBAC?

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a security model that restricts system access to authorised users based on their roles within an organisation. Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, RBAC assigns permissions to roles, and users are then assigned to those roles. This approach simplifies management and enhances security.

## Core Concepts of RBAC

- **Users:** Individuals who need access to the system.
- **Roles:** Named job functions or titles (e.g., "Admin", "Editor", "Viewer") that define a set of permissions.
- **Permissions:** Approval to perform certain operations (e.g., read, write, delete) on resources.
- **Sessions:** A mapping between a user and activated roles during a login session.

**How it works:**  
1. Define roles based on job functions.
2. Assign permissions to each role.
3. Assign users to appropriate roles.
4. Users inherit permissions through their roles.

## Benefits of RBAC

- **Simplified Administration:** Manage permissions by role, not by individual user.
- **Improved Security:** Reduces risk of excessive permissions and enforces least privilege.
- **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory requirements by controlling and auditing access.

## Best Practices for Implementing RBAC

- Identify and define roles clearly based on organisational needs.
- Assign only necessary permissions to each role (principle of least privilege).
- Regularly review and update roles and permissions.
- Monitor and audit role assignments and access patterns.
