```python
# Mental Health Screening Agent
class MentalHealthAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assessment_tools = [
            "PHQ-9",  # Depression screening
            "GAD-7",  # Anxiety screening
            "K10",    # Psychological distress (used in NZ)
            "DASS-21" # Depression, Anxiety, Stress
        ]
        
    def screen_mental_health(self, user_input):
        risk_level = self.assess_risk(user_input)
        if risk_level == "high":
            return self.emergency_protocol()
        elif risk_level == "moderate":
            return self.refer_to_services()
        else:
            return self.provide_resources()
    
    def emergency_protocol(self):
        return {
            "message": "I'm concerned about your safety. Please contact:",
            "emergency_contacts": {
                "lifeline": "0508 828 865",
                "crisis_text": "Text 234",
                "police_emergency": "111"
            }
        }
```

### 4. **Chronic Disease Management**

New Zealand has high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Azure Healthcare Agent Service can provide:

```dax
// Power BI Integration for Population Health Insights
Diabetes_Management_Metrics = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Patients[PatientID]),
    Patients[Condition] = "Type 2 Diabetes",
    Patients[Agent_Interactions] > 0
)

Medication_Adherence_Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNT(Patients[MedicationTaken]),
    COUNT(Patients[MedicationPrescribed]),
    0
) * 100
```

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Azure Healthcare Agent Service

```bash
# Azure CLI setup for New Zealand deployment
az login
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"

# Create resource group in Australia East (closest region)
az group create --name "nz-healthcare-rg" --location "australiaeast"

# Deploy Healthcare Bot Service
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group "nz-healthcare-rg" \
  --template-file "healthcare-bot-template.json" \
  --parameters location="australiaeast" \
               botName="nz-health-assistant" \
               compliance="healthcare"
```

### Step 2: FHIR Integration for New Zealand Health System

```json
{
  "fhir_server": {
    "endpoint": "https://nz-health-fhir.azurehealthcareapis.com",
    "version": "R4",
    "authentication": {
      "type": "Azure AD",
      "tenant": "health.govt.nz"
    },
    "data_mapping": {
      "nhi_number": "Patient.identifier",
      "healthcare_provider": "Organization.identifier",
      "consultation_notes": "Encounter.note"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Power BI Integration for Health Analytics

```powerquery
// Connect to Healthcare Agent Data
let
    Source = AzureStorage.Blobs("https://nzhealthdata.blob.core.windows.net/"),
    AgentInteractions = Source{[Name="agent-interactions.csv"]}[Content],
    ConvertedData = Csv.Document(AgentInteractions, [Delimiter=",", Columns=10]),
    PromotedHeaders = Table.PromoteHeaders(ConvertedData),
    
    // Transform for New Zealand specific analysis
    AddedRegion = Table.AddColumn(PromotedHeaders, "Region", 
        each if Text.Contains([Location], "Auckland") then "Auckland"
        else if Text.Contains([Location], "Wellington") then "Wellington"
        else if Text.Contains([Location], "Christchurch") then "Canterbury"
        else "Other"),
    
    // Add Māori health indicators
    AddedEthnicityFlag = Table.AddColumn(AddedRegion, "IsMāori", 
        each Text.Contains([Ethnicity], "Māori"))
in
    AddedEthnicityFlag
```

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

### New Zealand Healthcare Regulations

#### 1. **Privacy Act 2020**
```typescript
interface PrivacyCompliance {
  dataCollection: {
    purpose: "Healthcare service delivery";
    consent: "Explicit and informed";
    retention: "7 years or as required by Health Records Act";
  };
  dataSharing: {
    healthProviders: "Permitted with consent";
    research: "De-identified data only";
    overseas: "Restricted - data sovereignty required";
  };
}
```

#### 2. **Health Information Privacy Code**
- Patient access to their own health information
- Secure transmission and storage requirements
- Audit trails for all data access
- Right to correction and deletion

#### 3. **Medicines Act and Therapeutic Products Act**
- No prescribing capabilities for AI agents
- Clear disclaimers about medical advice limitations
- Integration with registered healthcare providers only

### Technical Security Implementation

```yaml
security_configuration:
  encryption:
    at_rest: "AES-256"
    in_transit: "TLS 1.3"
  authentication:
    provider: "Azure AD B2C"
    mfa_required: true
  audit_logging:
    enabled: true
    retention: "7 years"
    compliance: ["SOC2", "ISO27001", "HIPAA"]
```
