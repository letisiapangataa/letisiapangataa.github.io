Azure Sentinel is Microsoft's cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solution. If you're new to security monitoring or considering a move to cloud-native security tools, this guide will help you understand what Azure Sentinel is, why it matters, and how to get started.

Please refer to this link [Microsoft Sentinel Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview?tabs=defender-portal) for further information.

## What is Azure Sentinel?

Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native security analytics platform that helps organisations:

- **Collect** security data from virtually any source
- **Detect** threats using built-in machine learning and analytics

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS CloudTrail, Google Cloud Platform
- **Network Devices**: Firewalls, proxies, DNS servers
- **Custom Connectors**: REST APIs, Syslog, CEF (Common Event Format)

### 2. **Analytics Rules**
Analytics rules define what constitutes suspicious or malicious activity:

- **Scheduled Rules**: Run queries at regular intervals
- **Microsoft Security Rules**: Alerts from other Microsoft security products
- **Fusion Rules**: ML-powered correlation of multiple weak signals
- **Anomaly Rules**: Machine learning-based behavioural analysis

### 3. **Workbooks**
Interactive dashboards that provide visual insights into your security data:

- Pre-built templates for common scenarios
- Custom visualisations using KQL queries
- Real-time and historical views
- Shareable across teams

### 4. **Playbooks**
Automated response workflows using Azure Logic Apps:

- Incident enrichment
- Notification workflows
- Automated remediation
- Integration with third-party tools

## Getting Started: Your First Steps

### Step 1: Prerequisites
Before setting up Azure Sentinel, ensure you have:

- **Azure subscription** with appropriate permissions
- **Log Analytics workspace** (Sentinel's data store)
- **Security Reader** or **Sentinel Contributor** role
- Understanding of your organisation's data sources

### Step 2: Enable Azure Sentinel
1. Navigate to the Azure portal
2. Search for "Azure Sentinel"
3. Click "Create Azure Sentinel"
4. Select or create a Log Analytics workspace
5. Click "Add Azure Sentinel"

### Step 3: Connect Your First Data Source
Start with Microsoft services for the easiest setup:

1. Go to **Data connectors** in Sentinel
2. Select **Azure Activity** connector
3. Click **Open connector page**
4. Follow the configuration steps
5. Verify data is flowing in the **Logs** section

### Step 4: Explore Pre-built Content
Azure Sentinel comes with hundreds of pre-built rules and workbooks:

1. Navigate to **Analytics** > **Rule templates**
2. Browse available detection rules
3. Enable rules relevant to your environment
4. Check **Workbooks** for visualisation templates

## Understanding KQL (Kusto Query Language)

KQL is the query language used throughout Azure Sentinel. Here are some beginner-friendly examples:

### Basic Query Structure
```kql
// Get all Azure Activity logs from the last 24 hours
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| take 10
```

### Filtering and Aggregation
```kql
// Count login failures by user
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != "0"  // Failed logins
| summarize FailedLogins = count() by UserPrincipalName
| order by FailedLogins desc
```

### Time-based Analysis
```kql
// Login activity over time
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize LoginCount = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| render timechart
```

## Common Use Cases for Beginners

### 1. **Monitor Failed Login Attempts**
Detect potential brute force attacks by monitoring authentication failures:

```kql
SigninLogs
| where ResultType != "0"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
| summarize FailureCount = count() by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| where FailureCount > 5
| order by FailureCount desc
```

### 2. **Track Administrative Activities**
Monitor privileged operations in your Azure environment:

```kql
AzureActivity
| where CategoryValue == "Administrative"
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, OperationNameValue, ResourceGroup
```

### 3. **Identify Unusual Network Traffic**
Analyse network connections for anomalous patterns:

```kql
CommonSecurityLog
| where DeviceVendor == "Palo Alto Networks"
| where Activity == "TRAFFIC"
| summarize BytesReceived = sum(ReceivedBytes) by SourceIP
| order by BytesReceived desc
| take 20
```

## Best Practices for Beginners
