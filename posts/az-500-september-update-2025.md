Kia ora,

I hadn't realised I had active readers on this notebook, which is delightful! xD 

It is a technical notebook used to store technical notes on projects or anything related to my career in technology or information and knowledge I may need to revise in the future.

I've originally booked my exam on October 2025 so it is weeks away, I am caught between the gaps of building technical projects for practical use, professional use, portfolio use, deploying them into github and learning new technology - upskilling consistently is my priority at the current moment.

I am genuinely passionate about technology and is the career that I look to grow in the years to come.

Will keep this updated until then with more of my learnings and interesting things. 

I see this as a little library of books.

Ka kite ano,

Letisia T Pangata'a.
