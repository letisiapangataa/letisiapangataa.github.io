**Ansible** is an open-source automation tool that enables IT professionals to automate configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration tasks across servers and cloud environments. Its agentless architecture and human-readable YAML syntax make it accessible for beginners and powerful for advanced users.

---

## Why Use Ansible?

- **Agentless:** No software needs to be installed on managed nodesâ€”Ansible uses SSH or WinRM.
- **Simple Syntax:** Playbooks are written in YAML, making them easy to read and write.
- **Idempotent:** Tasks can be safely run multiple times without causing unintended changes.
- **Extensible:** Supports modules for cloud, network, containers, and more.
- **Community Driven:** A large ecosystem of roles, modules, and plugins.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Inventory:** A list of hosts (servers, VMs, containers) to manage, defined in an INI or YAML file.
- **Modules:** Reusable scripts that perform tasks (e.g., install packages, copy files).
- **Playbooks:** YAML files that define automation workflows as a series of tasks.
- **Roles:** Organised collections of tasks, variables, files, and templates for reuse.
- **Variables & Templates:** Customise behaviour and generate dynamic configuration files.

## Example: A Simple Playbook

Below is a basic playbook to install Nginx on Ubuntu servers:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Nginx on web servers
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
