## Introduction

This guide is for users who are already familiar with the basics of Microsoft Fabric and want to explore more advanced capabilities. We’ll cover best practices, advanced features, and practical tips for building robust analytics solutions.

## Advanced Data Engineering

- **Lakehouses**: Use Lakehouses to combine the flexibility of data lakes with the structure of data warehouses. Store raw, curated, and transformed data in a single platform.
- **Notebooks**: Leverage integrated notebooks (PySpark, SQL, etc.) for data exploration, transformation, and machine learning workflows.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Schedule and automate complex data workflows using Data Factory pipelines within Fabric.

### Tutorial Project: IoT Analytics Pipeline

#### Scenario
Build an end-to-end analytics solution that ingests IoT sensor data, transforms it, stores it in a Lakehouse, and visualises insights in Power BI.

#### Step 1: Ingest IoT Data
- Use a Dataflow Gen2 to connect to an Azure Event Hub streaming IoT data.
- Configure the Dataflow to map incoming JSON fields to structured columns.

#### Step 2: Store in Lakehouse
- Output the Dataflow to a Lakehouse table (e.g., `dbo.SensorReadings`).
- Use partitioning on the ingestion timestamp for efficient querying.

#### Step 3: Data Transformation
- Open a PySpark notebook in Fabric.
- Read the Lakehouse table, clean the data (e.g., handle missing values), and calculate aggregates (e.g., hourly averages).
- Write the transformed data back to a curated Lakehouse table.

```python
# Example PySpark code
df = spark.read.table("dbo.SensorReadings")
df_clean = df.dropna()
df_agg = df_clean.groupBy("deviceId", window("timestamp", "1 hour")).avg("temperature")
df_agg.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("dbo.SensorHourlyAverages")
```

#### Step 4: Real-Time Analytics
- Create a KQL database in Fabric Real-Time Analytics.
- Set up a streaming ingestion from the Lakehouse or Event Hub.
- Write KQL queries to detect anomalies or threshold breaches.

#### Step 5: Visualise in Power BI
- Connect Power BI to the Lakehouse or KQL database.
- Build dashboards showing live sensor readings, historical trends, and detected anomalies.

## Data Integration & Transformation

- **Dataflows Gen2**: Build reusable ETL logic with Dataflows Gen2. Use mapping dataflows for scalable, code-free transformations.
- **Incremental Refresh**: Optimise refresh performance by only processing new or changed data.
- **Parameterisation**: Use parameters in pipelines and dataflows for flexible, reusable solutions.

## Advanced Analytics

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Ingest and analyse streaming data using KQL databases and Real-Time Analytics experiences.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Train and deploy models directly within Fabric using integrated ML tools and connect to Azure Machine Learning for advanced scenarios.
- **Semantic Models**: Build robust semantic models in Power BI for enterprise-grade reporting and self-service analytics.

## Security & Governance

- **Data Lineage**: Track data movement and transformations across your Fabric environment for compliance and troubleshooting.
- **Sensitivity Labels**: Apply and enforce sensitivity labels to protect confidential data.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement granular permissions at the workspace, dataset, and report levels.

## Monitoring & Optimisation

- **Usage Metrics**: Monitor workspace, dataset, and report usage to optimise performance and adoption.
- **Cost Management**: Use Fabric’s built-in cost analysis tools to track and manage resource consumption.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimise queries, data models, and refresh schedules for best performance.

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combine data from on-premises, cloud, and SaaS sources for unified analytics.
- **End-to-End Analytics Solution**: Example: Ingest IoT sensor data, transform it in a Lakehouse, analyse with notebooks, and visualise in Power BI.
- **Collaboration**: Use workspaces, version control, and deployment pipelines for team-based development.
