This post discusses development process and codebase structure of the **A.I-powered Student Support Chatbot** project. The chatbot is designed to assist students by answering their queries using a knowledge base and providing a web-based chat interface. The project is organized into three main components: the backend bot, the knowledge base, and the web frontend.

## Project Structure

```

├── README.md
├── bot/

```

### 1. `bot/` — The Backend Chatbot
- **`app.py`**: The main Python application that powers the chatbot logic and API.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.

### 2. `qna/` — The Knowledge Base
- **`knowledge-base.tsv`**: A tab-separated file containing question-answer pairs used by the chatbot to respond to user queries.

### 3. `web/` — The Frontend
- **`index.html`**: The main web page for the chat interface.
- **`chatbot.js`**: Handles frontend logic, user input, and communication with the backend.
- **`styles.css`**: Styles for the chat interface.

---

## Backend: `bot/app.py`

The backend is a Python Flask application that exposes an API endpoint for the chatbot. It loads the knowledge base and matches user questions to the best answer.

**Key Features:**
- Loads Q&A pairs from `qna/knowledge-base.tsv`.
- Uses simple text matching or NLP techniques to find the best answer.
- Exposes a `/chat` endpoint for frontend communication.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import csv

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load knowledge base
def load_knowledge_base(path):
    kb = []
    with open(path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter='\t')
        for row in reader:
            if len(row) == 2:
                kb.append({'question': row[0], 'answer': row[1]})
    return kb

knowledge_base = load_knowledge_base('../qna/knowledge-base.tsv')

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get('message', '')
    # ...matching logic...
    return jsonify({'answer': best_answer})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

## Knowledge Base: `qna/knowledge-base.tsv`

This file contains the core Q&A data. Each line is a tab-separated pair:

```
How do I reset my password?\tYou can reset your password by ...
Where can I find my grades?\tYour grades are available on ...
```

You can expand this file to cover more topics as needed.

---

## Frontend: `web/`

The frontend is a simple, modern web interface for chatting with the bot.

### `index.html`
- Contains the chat window and input form.

### `chatbot.js`
- Handles sending user messages to the backend and displaying responses.
- Uses `fetch` to POST messages to `/chat`.

**Sample Code Snippet:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('chat-form').addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const input = document.getElementById('user-input');
  const message = input.value;
  // ...display user message...
  const response = await fetch('/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  // ...display bot response...
});
```

### `styles.css`
- Provides a clean, user-friendly chat UI.

## Development Workflow

1. **Set up the backend:**
   - Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r bot/requirements.txt`
   - Run the Flask app: `python bot/app.py`
2. **Edit the knowledge base:**
   - Add or update Q&A pairs in `qna/knowledge-base.tsv`.
3. **Launch the frontend:**
   - Open `web/index.html` in your browser.
   - Ensure the backend is running and accessible.

---

## Extending the Project

- **Improve matching:** Integrate NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for better question understanding.
- **Authentication:** Add user login for personalized support.
- **Deployment:** Use Docker or cloud services for production deployment.

## Conclusion

The Student Support Chatbot is a modular, extensible project that demonstrates how to combine a Python backend, a simple knowledge base, and a modern web frontend to deliver real-time support to students. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
