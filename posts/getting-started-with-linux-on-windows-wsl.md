## Introduction

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/tutorials/linux) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows 11. WSL enables developers, system engineers, and students to use Linux tools and workflows directly within their Windows environment, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

---

## Why Use WSL?

- **Seamless Integration:** Run Linux command-line tools alongside Windows applications.
- **Development Flexibility:** Access popular Linux development tools, scripting languages, and package managers.
- **Resource Efficiency:** WSL uses fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
- **Easy Setup:** Install and configure Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store with just a few commands.

---

## Setting Up WSL

1. **Enable WSL Feature:**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```
     wsl --install
     ```
   - This command installs WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution.

2. **Restart Your Computer:**  
   - A restart may be required to complete the installation.

3. **Set Up Your Linux Distribution:**
   - After restarting, launch your chosen Linux distribution from the Start menu.
   - Create a user account and password when prompted.

4. **Update and Upgrade Packages:**
   - Once inside the Linux terminal, update your package lists:
     ```
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
     ```

## Using Linux on Windows

- **Access Files:**  
  Your Windows files are accessible from within Linux at `/mnt/c/`.
- **Install Software:**  
  Use your distribution’s package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu) to install development tools and utilities.
- **Run Linux Commands:**  
  Use Bash, Python, Git, and other Linux tools natively.

## Advanced Features

- **WSL 2:**  
  Offers improved performance and full system call compatibility using a lightweight virtual machine.
- **Graphical Linux Apps:**  
  WSL now supports running Linux GUI applications on Windows 11.
- **Multiple Distributions:**  
  Install and manage multiple Linux distributions side by side.
