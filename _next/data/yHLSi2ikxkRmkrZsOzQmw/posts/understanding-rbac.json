Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, RBAC assigns permissions to roles, and users are then assigned to those roles. This approach simplifies management and enhances security.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Core Concepts of RBAC</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Users:</strong> Individuals who need access to the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Roles:</strong> Named job functions or titles (e.g., \"Admin\", \"Editor\", \"Viewer\") that define a set of permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Approval to perform certain operations (e.g., read, write, delete) on resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Sessions:</strong> A mapping between a user and activated roles during a login session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define roles based on job functions.</li>\n<li>Assign permissions to each role.</li>\n<li>Assign users to appropriate roles.</li>\n<li>Users inherit permissions through their roles.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>Benefits of RBAC</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplified Administration:</strong> Manage permissions by role, not by individual user.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> Reduces risk of excessive permissions and enforces least privilege.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Helps meet regulatory requirements by controlling and auditing access.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Best Practices for Implementing RBAC</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and define roles clearly based on organisational needs.</li>\n<li>Assign only necessary permissions to each role (principle of least privilege).</li>\n<li>Regularly review and update roles and permissions.</li>\n<li>Monitor and audit role assignments and access patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>References &#x26; Further Reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/role-based-access-control\">NIST RBAC Model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview\">Microsoft RBAC Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/Access_Control\">OWASP: Access Control</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>RBAC is a proven and scalable way to manage access in modern IT environments, from cloud platforms to enterprise applications.
