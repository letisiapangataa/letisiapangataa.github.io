SIEM solutions collect, analyse, and correlate security data from across an organisationâ€™s IT environment, helping security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats.</p>\n<h2>What is SIEM?</h2>\n<p>SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It combines two key functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security Information Management (SIM):</strong> Collects and stores log data for analysis and compliance.</li>\n<li><strong>Security Event Management (SEM):</strong> Monitors, analyses, and correlates real-time events for threat detection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is SIEM Important?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Centralised Visibility:</strong> Aggregate logs and events from servers, endpoints, network devices, and cloud services.</li>\n<li><strong>Threat Detection:</strong> Identify suspicious activity, policy violations, and potential attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Enable faster investigation and remediation of security incidents.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) with audit trails and reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key Features of SIEM</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Log Collection &#x26; Normalisation:</strong> Ingest data from diverse sources and standardise formats.</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation Rules:</strong> Detect complex attack patterns by linking related events.</li>\n<li><strong>Alerting:</strong> Notify security teams of critical incidents in real time.</li>\n<li><strong>Dashboards &#x26; Reporting:</strong> Visualise security posture and trends.</li>\n<li><strong>Forensics &#x26; Investigation:</strong> Drill down into historical data for root cause analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How SIEM Works</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Agents or APIs gather logs from endpoints, servers, firewalls, and cloud services.</li>\n<li><strong>Normalisation:</strong> Data is parsed and standardised for analysis.</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation &#x26; Analysis:</strong> Rules and machine learning identify threats and anomalies.</li>\n<li><strong>Alerting:</strong> Security teams are notified of high-risk events.</li>\n<li><strong>Response:</strong> Incidents are investigated and remediated.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Popular SIEM Solutions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microsoft Sentinel</strong> (cloud-native)</li>\n<li><strong>Splunk</strong></li>\n<li><strong>IBM QRadar</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Elastic SIEM</strong></li>\n<li><strong>ArcSight</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Best Practices for SIEM Deployment</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start with Critical Data Sources:</strong> Onboard domain controllers, firewalls, and cloud accounts first.</li>\n<li><strong>Tune Correlation Rules:</strong> Reduce false positives by customising alerts.</li>\n<li><strong>Automate Where Possible:</strong> Use playbooks and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) integrations.</li>\n<li><strong>Regularly Review &#x26; Update:</strong> Adapt to new threats and business changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A SIEM is essential for proactive security monitoring and compliance. By centralising and analysing security data, organisations can detect threats faster and respond more effectively.</p>\n","difficulty":"Easy"}},"__N_SSG":true}
