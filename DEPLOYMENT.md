This guide will help you deploy the revamped portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- Git installed and configured
- GitHub account with repository access
- Ruby 3.2+ (for local development only)

## Quick Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Direct Push (Recommended)

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Revamp portfolio with modern design and enhanced features"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source
   - The site will automatically build and deploy

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Automated)

The repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`) that will:

- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Handle all dependencies and build processes

## Local Development (Optional)

If you want to test locally before deploying:

### Windows Setup
